## Applications of Generative AI in Data Science and Economics

**Course Category (DS):** Group B Elective for the Sequence, or as an Elective for the Major

**Course Category (Econ):** Level II Elective

**Meetings:** Weekly, Wednesday, 1:00 pm

**Faculty Reader:** Doug Goodwin, Scripps

**Secondary Faculty Reader:** Michael Gelman

**Data Science Department Chair:** Mark Huber

**Economics Department Chair:** David Bjerk

### Course Objectives:
This independent study course explores the practical applications of generative AI, focusing on various models and their real-world applications in data science and economics. Through a series of project-based assignments, students will gain hands-on experience working with generative AI models and develop a strong understanding of their potential impact on these fields. This 14-week course comprises four projects, with one due every 3-4 weeks. The majority of projects are on applying generative AI frameworks within economic modeling/data science. There are also 6 readings to complete that go alongside these projects; these readings are heavily focused on economics (thank you to Professor Gelman for his suggestions).

## Course Outline

### Project 1 - LSTM Models and Labor Markets

Due Sep 22

Description: 
In this project, students will delve into the realm of time series data analysis and use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to model and forecast labor market trends.

Explanation:
 LSTM networks are a type of deep learning model designed to capture sequential patterns. They have gained popularity in economics for their ability to handle time series data effectively. Students will preprocess labor market data, engineer relevant features, and implement LSTM models to predict unemployment rates or job demand.

Learning outcomes:
- Understanding time series data in economics.
- Introduction to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering for labor market data.
- Building and training LSTM models for labor market forecasting.

### Project 2 - Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Economic/Financial Data

Due Oct 13

Description: 
This project focuses on the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to analyze economic and financial data. VAEs are generative models that can uncover hidden patterns and anomalies in complex datasets.

Explanation:
 VAEs are powerful tools for unsupervised learning, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data. Students will apply VAEs to generate synthetic economic data, such as stock prices or consumer behavior, and detect anomalies in financial time series, providing insights for risk assessment or investment strategies.

Learning Outcomes:
- Introduction to Variational Autoencoders (VAE).
- Data generation and anomaly detection using VAEs.
- Application of VAEs to financial and economic data.
- Evaluation of VAE models for economic analysis.

### Project 3 - Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models for Public Policy Economics

Due Nov 3

Description:
Students will explore Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling, a foundational approach in public policy economics. CGE models are used to assess the impacts of economic policies on various sectors and factors.

Explanation:
CGE models are essential for policymakers to evaluate the consequences of different economic policies. In this project, students will prepare economic data, construct a CGE model, and simulate policy scenarios. They will analyze how changes in tax policy or trade agreements affect employment, income distribution, and other economic variables, providing valuable insights for policy recommendations.

Learning Outcomes:
- Introduction to CGE models and their role in public policy.
- Data preparation for CGE modeling.
- Building and simulating CGE models to assess policy impacts.
- Policy analysis and interpretation of results.

### Project 4 - Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) in Economics

Due Dec 1

Description: 
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a simulation technique where individual agents interact within a defined environment, mimicking real-world dynamics. Students will use ABM creatively to study a unique economic scenario.

Explanation: 
ABM is a versatile modeling approach suited for studying emergent phenomena and complex systems. In this project, students will design an ABM to explore a specific economic question, such as the diffusion of innovation, traffic congestion, or housing market dynamics. They will define agent behaviors, set up the environment, and conduct experiments to draw insights and suggest potential policy interventions.

Learning Outcomes: 
- Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and its applications.
- Designing and implementing an ABM for a unique economic scenario.
- Parameter tuning and sensitivity analysis.
- Simulation-based policy recommendations and visualization.
